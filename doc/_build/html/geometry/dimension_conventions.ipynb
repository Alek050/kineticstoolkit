    "Dimension conventions\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "\n",
    "We remind an important convention in Kinetics Toolkit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every point, vector or matrix, and in many case even scalar, is considered as a **series**.\n",
    "- The first dimension of any series corresponds to **time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand better how to express series of scalars, vectors, points, sets and matrices, please refer to the following pictures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Series of scalars\n",

    "![Series of m scalars](../_static/geometry/series_of_m_scalars.png){ width=330px }\n",
    "\n",
    "Series of vectors and points\n",
    "----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "![Series of m vectors](../_static/geometry/series_of_m_vectors.png){ width=330px } ![Series of m points](../_static/geometry/series_of_m_points.png){ width=330px }\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the difference between vectors and points: vectors (e.g., forces, velocities) have zeros as their fourth coordinate while points (e.g., marker coordinates) have ones. This difference has an impact on algeabric calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A rigid transformation of a vector gives a new rotated vector expressed as a new orientation and amplitude.\n",
    "- A rigid transformation on a point yields a translated point expressed as its new coordinates in the new reference frame.\n",

    "Series of groups of vectors or points\n",

    "Working with constants\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most signals in Kinetics Toolkit as considered as a series, always ensure that the first dimension of any array is reserved to time. For example, the vector (x = 1, y = 2, z = 3) must be expressed as `np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0]])` (note the double brackets). A common error would be to express it as `np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0])` (single brackets), which would mean a series of 4 floats instead of one constant vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick way to convert a constant array to a series is to use numpy's `newaxis`:"
