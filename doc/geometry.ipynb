    "\n",
    "- Dimension 0 = time (length of m). Constants are expressed as series with m = 1 and are broadcasted to match other series with m > 1.\n",

    "Since everything in the `geometry` module is considered as a series, always ensure that the first dimension of any array is reserved to time. For example, the vector (x = 1, y = 2, z = 3) must be expressed as `np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0]])` (note the double brackets). A common error would be to express it as `np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0])` (single brackets), which would mean a series of 4 floats instead of one constant vector.\n",
