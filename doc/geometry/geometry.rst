Rigid body geometry
===================

The geometry_ module simplifies the calculation of linear algebric operations on series of points, vectors and transformation matrices.

In this tutorial, we will do a quick starter on what is a reference frame and its relation with rigid transformation matrices, how to express and navigate between reference frames and local/global coordinates, and how to extract rotation angles from a series of transformation matrices.
